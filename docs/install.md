::: warning
**Svelte Standalone** is compatible with both **Svelte 4** and **Svelte 5**. Ensure you install the correct version for your Svelte setup to avoid compatibility issues.
:::

# Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up **Svelte Standalone** in your project:

1. **Create a New Svelte App**: Use the [Svelte CLI](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/creating-a-project) and choose the tools that best fit your workflow.
2. **Clean Up Boilerplate Code**:
   Delete the boilerplate code generated by Svelte, but **make sure to keep the `app.html` file**.
3. **Install Svelte Standalone**

:::tip
*My current workflows include Svelte 4 with **Svelte Standalone**. This version is well tested and used in a daily basis.*

*If you want to use it as myself, create your Svelte project - with the svelte CLI - and downgrade the following dependencies: `svelte@4 @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte@3`*
:::

### For **Svelte 4**:

```bash
npm install -D svelte-standalone@latest
```

### For **Svelte 5**:

```bash
npm install -D svelte-standalone@beta
```
